// Given two crystal balls that will break if dropped from high enough
// distance, determine the exact spot in which it will break in the most optimized way
// or (You are in a 100 story building and you have 2 crystal balls and want to find out at which floor will they break)

// we can break down the solution to an array full of false and one true like:
// [f, f, f, f, t, t, t, t, t, t] (true is the floor where the balls start breaking)

// Problems:
// Linear search is O(N), and binary search with two crystal balls still results in O(N) time complexity, as the second ball requires a linear search after the first ball breaks

// Solution: Jump by square root of N, then linearly search backwards to find the exact breaking point, resulting in a O(√N) time complexity
